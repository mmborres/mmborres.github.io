<h2>&diams; Instructions &diams;</h2>
<p class="instruct">Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

<p class="instruct">Playing is very simple - you turn over one card and then try to find a matching card. There are 20 levels to unlock as you try to score higher. Score is 1 point for two cards matched. For unmatched cards, it is recorded as 1 wrong move. To unlock a level, you need 10 points and increments of that.</p>

<p class="instruct">Buttons Usage - What are these buttons for?</p>

<p class="instruct"><button>Wanna Score Higher? Play Again!</button> This button allows you to play the game again without resetting your score to zero. Cool, isn't it?</p>

<p class="instruct"><button>Check Total Score</button> This button lets you check your current score, with the number of wrong moves too. Tsk...</p>

<p class="instruct"><button>Restart Game, Back to Zero</button> Having that Game Over feeling? This button resets the game, everything back to zero. Unless you are sure, don't attempt to click this button. Gets?</p>

<p class="instruct">PLEASE NOTE that while you are in the Game page, you cannot visit any of the navigation links. Otherwise, it also resets the game. That's life as you know it.</p>
