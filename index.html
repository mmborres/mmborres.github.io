<p class="gameinfo">This browser-based game is originally by <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/locations/sydney" class="contactdetails" target="_blank">GA</a> and then enhanced by <a href="mailto:mmborres@gmail.com?Subject=Memory%20Card%20Game" class="contactdetails" target="_top">Mabeth Borres</a> of WDI 2019.</p>

<p class="gameinfo">Two Versions of the Memory Card Game:</p>

<p class="gameinfo">1) Accumulating Points &star;<br><a href="https://mmborres.github.io/memory_game/" class="contactdetails" target="_blank">
mmborres@github/memory_game</a>
<br>This application is built on top of the base code from the pre-work module. Game rules are defined as to accumulating points and reaching maximum levels, which can be customised. Utilises HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Tested on Mac, Windows, and Android.
</p>

<p class="gameinfo">2) Increasing Difficulty Levels &star;&star;&star;<br><a href="https://mmborres.github.io/memgame_difficulty/" class="contactdetails" target="_blank">mmborres@github/memgame_difficulty</a>
<br>Taking the base memory card game to the next level, this application uses increasing difficulty per level by adding a row of cards to the board. Unlocking a level means clearing the board of matched cards. Similarly, the number of levels can also be customised. Utilises HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Tested on Mac, Windows, and Android.
