<p class="gameinfo"><b>Memory Card Game</b> is a browser-based game originally by <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/locations/sydney" class="contactdetails" target="_blank">GA</a>, and then enhanced by <a href="mailto:mmborres@gmail.com?Subject=Memory%20Card%20Game" class="contactdetails" target="_top">Mabeth Borres</a> of WDI 2019.</p>

<p class="gameinfo"><b>Two Versions of the Memory Card Game</b></p>

<p class="gameinfo">1) Accumulating Points:  <a href="memory_game/index.html" class="contactdetails">
Memory Game Score Top-Up</a> &star;
<br><br>This application is built on top of the base code from the pre-work module. Game rules are defined as to accumulating points and reaching maximum levels, which can be customised. Utilises HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Tested on Mac, Windows, and Android.
</p>

<p class="gameinfo">2) Increasing Difficulty Levels:  <a href="memgame_difficulty/index.html" class="contactdetails">Memory Game Level-Up</a> &star;&star;&star;
<br><br>Taking the base memory card game to the next level, this application uses increasing difficulty per level by adding a row of cards to the board. Unlocking a level means clearing the board of matched cards. Similarly, the number of levels can also be customised. Utilises HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Tested on Mac, Windows, and Android.
